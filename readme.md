# Lilyturf is a simple template engine for CoffeeScript

### Usage

Require `page/lilyturf.js` in your HTML and follow my examples.  
I'm afraid you should read my code to see how to use it.  
And there's a demo you can visit on: http://jiyinyiyong.github.com/lilyturf/page  

By now I only tested it on Chrome. be careful if you want to use it.  

### Goal

I hate crazy brackets, I hate many close tags.  
Let it be simple to template HTML in CoffeeScript!  

Originally parsted on Gist: https://gist.github.com/2498711  
After a long time, I found it was almost what I wanted.  
So I will make it a repo, hope it helps.
